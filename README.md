# Requesting Courses in UCloud 

This README contains information about the following:

- The requirements for being eligible to use this GitHub repositoryto  set up courses in [UCloud](cloud.sdu.dk).
- General things to keep in mind when requesting courses.
- An outline of services offered.
- An outline of the financial model.
- The teacher agreement.

## Requirements 

Before requesting a new course on UCloud, the teacher should make sure that the following requirements are met: 

1. The course should be public (see more [below](./ucloud-courses-requirements.md#general-considerations)).
2. The course should be associated either with an existing course, or with a course which is planned and approved to take place in the foreseeable future.  
3. The course should be for students enrolled at a Danish university.
4. The teacher should be the course responsible and employed at a post-PhD level (i.e., postdoc, assistant/associate/full professor).

## General Considerations

### Course materials on GitHub are public

UCloud courses are developed in the present [public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility) GitHub repository. This means that:

1. Teachers must consent to their material being, and remaining, publicly available in the repository.  
2. Teachers should **never** include datasets and other potentially sensitive information in the GitHub repository. 
    - Datasets etc., must always be handled seperately in a decicated [UCloud Project](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/guide/project-intro.html).

### The teacher is the course developer 

Course development should be done by the teacher using the pre-made scripts available in this repository. Once a course is deployed on UCloud, it will be avaible to all Danish universities. 

### Course updates are conducted bi-annually 

As a general rule, courses are updated before the beginning of each spring- and fall semesters. Potential bugs are fixed continuously. 

### After a course is completed 

When a course is completed, it will remain available on UCloud by default. This will allow the teacher to update and reuse the course material in later semesters, and make it possible for other teachers to use the course material as well. 

It is possible to have a course removed from UCloud. If this is desired, the teacher requests the removal of the courses. When the request has been approved, the course in question will be scheduled for removal and will be marked as such in UCloud. The removal will only take place in the next [bi-annual update](ucloud-courses-requirements.md#course-updates-are-conducted-bi-annually) to ensure that any ongoing use of the course by others can be completed before the removal.

::: {note}

It is never possible to remove course materials from the GitHub repository. Thus, removing a course from UCloud will *not* remove the corresponding course material from the GitHub repository.
