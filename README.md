# Requesting Courses in UCloud 

This README contains information about the following:

- Requirements when developing a UCloud course.
- General considerations to keep in mind when requesting courses.
- Outline of services offered.
- Outline of the financial model.
- Teacher agreement.

Below, the term *Course* refers to the university-approved course while *digital course* (UCloud) refers to the course deployment on UCloud.

## Requirements 

Before requesting a new UCloud course, the teacher should make sure that the following requirements are met: 

1. The UCloud digital course is associated with an academic course, which is already existing or planned and approved to take place in the foreseeable future.  
2. The digital course has been developed by using the *UCloud-Courses* GitHub repository scripts and templates.
3. The course is for students enrolled at a Danish university.
4. The teacher, responsible for the digital course development and maintainance, is employed at a post-PhD level (i.e., postdoc, assistant/associate/full professor).

## General Considerations

### Course materials on GitHub are public

UCloud courses are developed in the present [public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility) GitHub repository. This means that:

1. The UCloud course should be public (see more [below](./ucloud-courses-requirements.md#general-considerations)).
2. Teachers must consent to their material being, and remaining, publicly available in the repository.  
3. Teachers should **never** include datasets and other potentially sensitive information in the GitHub repository. 
    - Datasets etc., must always be handled seperately, for example in a decicated [UCloud Project](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/guide/project-intro.html).
4. UCloud courses can be used by other teachers, beside the developers.

### The teacher is the developer 

UCloud course development should be done by the teacher using the pre-made scripts available in this repository. Once a UCloud course has been deployed, it will be avaible to all Danish universities. 
The teacher is responsible also for providing a short guide on how-to-use the digital course (for students) and to the update of the digital course when necessary. 

### Course updates are conducted bi-annually 

As a general rule, UCloud courses are updated before the beginning of each spring- and fall semesters. Potential bugs are fixed continuously. 

### After a course is completed 

When the academic course is completed, the corresponding UCloud course will remain available on UCloud by default. This will allow the teacher to update and reuse the material in later semesters, and make it possible for other teachers to use the material as well. 

The teacher which developed the course can request to have the digital course removed from UCloud.
When the request has been approved, the UCloud course in question will be scheduled for removal and will be marked as such. The removal will only take place in the next [bi-annual update](ucloud-courses-requirements.md#course-updates-are-conducted-bi-annually) to ensure that any ongoing use of the UCloud course by others can be completed before the removal.

> It is never possible to remove materials from this GitHub repository. Thus, the removal of a UCloud course will *not* be followed by the removing of the corresponding material from the GitHub repository. 

## Outline of Services Offered 

The UCloud support teams will assist the teachers in the UCloud development course. This includes:

- Support during development of the digital course
- Review of the final material produced by teachers
- Implementation on the platform
